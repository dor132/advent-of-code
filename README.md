# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code puzzle game.

### Future ideas

- Each puzzle's input is given by a nice REST API endpoint. A single shared function between all puzzles solutions can be made and using a year and day the input can be retrieved using `requests.get`, eliminating the need for copy-pasted `input` file.
